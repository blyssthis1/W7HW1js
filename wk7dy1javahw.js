//==================Exercise #1 ==========//
/*Write a function that takes in the string and the list of dog names, loops through
the list and checks that the current name is in the string passed in. The output should be:
"Matched dog_name" if name is in the string, if no matches are present console.log "No Matches"
*/
let dog_string = "Hello Max, my name is Dog, and I have purple eyes!"
let dog_names = ["Max","HAS","PuRple","dog"]

  let foundMatch = false;
  for (let i = 0; i < dogNames.length; i++) {
    if (str.includes(dogNames[i])) {
      console.log(`Matched ${dogNames[i]}`);
      foundMatch = true;
    }
  }
  if (!foundMatch) {
    console.log("No Matches");
  }
}
//Call method here with parameters
//============Exercise #2 ============//
/*Write a fucntion that takes in an array and removes every even index with a splice,
and replaces it with the string "even index" */
//Given arr == ["Max","Baseball","Reboot","Goku","Trucks","Rodger"]
function replaceEvens(arr){
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      arr.splice(i, 1, "even index");
    }
  }
  return arr;
}
//Expected output
//Given arr == ["Max","Baseball","Reboot","Goku","Trucks","Rodger"]
//Output arr == ["even index","Baseball","even index","Goku","even index","Rodger"]
//============Exercise #3 ============//
/*Your job here is to write a function (keepOrder in JS/CoffeeScript,
keep_order in Ruby/Crystal/Python, keeporder in Julia), which takes a sorted array ary and a value val,
and returns the lowest index where you could insert val to maintain the sorted-ness of the array.
 The input array will always be sorted in ascending order. It may contain duplicates.
Do not modify the input.
Some examples:
keepOrder([1, 2, 3, 4, 7], 5) //=> 4
                      ^(index 4)
keepOrder([1, 2, 3, 4, 7], 0) //=> 0
          ^(index 0)
keepOrder([1, 1, 2, 2, 2], 2) //=> 2
                ^(index 2)
*/
function keepOrder(ary, val) {
    return ary.filter(a => a < val).length;
  }
//============Exercise #4 ============//
/*  Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.
Examples (input -> output)
6, "I"     -> "IIIIII"
5, "Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello" */
function repeatStr(n, s) {
  let result = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result += s;
  }
  return result;
